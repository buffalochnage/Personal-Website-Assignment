Project Overview
Repo: Personal-Website-Assignment
Project Name: MBA Life in the US

1. What’s this about?
    I’m building a personal website to share my experiences and tips about MBA life in the US. It’ll be a place for stories, advice, and resources for anyone interested in the MBA journey.

2. What am I trying to do?
    Make a website that’s both useful and nice to look at.
    Give real insights into school, career, friends, family, daily life, fun stuff, and getting around as an MBA student in America to complete my personal website

3. Who’s this for?
    People thinking about doing an MBA (especially in the US).
    International students curious about what it’s really like.
    Friends and family who want to follow along on my journey.

4. What will the site look like?
    index.html - Home/Welcome
    school-career.html - All about school and career stuff
    friends-family.html - Stories about friends and family
    life-leisure.html - Life outside of school: hobbies, travel, fun things
    Resource: Images (using .webp and .avif for fast loading)
    General CSS files for styling (in a /css folder)
    JavaScript files for interactivity (in a /js folder)

5. What features will it have?
    The site will look good on phones and computers (responsive design).
    Easy navigation bar to jump between pages.
    Clean, modern HTML5 structure.
    Lots of photos to bring the stories to life.
    Some simple interactive touches with JavaScript (like highlighting the current page or little animations).

6. Design ideas
    Stick to a few colors and fonts for a consistent look.
    Keep things clean and uncluttered.
    Make sure everyone can use the site: add alt text for images, make it keyboard-friendly.
    Optimize images so the site loads quickly.
